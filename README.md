# Personal Blog 

The website for this project can be found [here](https://personal-blog-justinshin6.vercel.app/) (deployed to Vercel).
### Project Overview/Movitation 
- Ever since when I first started to code, I wanted to make a personal blog because I wanted an 
avenue where I can share my thoughts on computer science, sports, and productivity to others. 
First, I chose to write about computer science because I love everything about the topic. I 
love how computer science is about problem solving and creation, so I wanted to showcase 
my interest in computer science to others while learning how to create a full-stack application
in the process. Second, I chose to write about sports because I grew up with a sports background.
I have played soccer since I was six and recently have begun to play basketball with my friends, so 
I follow most sports where the sports that I watch the most are soccer, basketball, and football. 
Third, I chose to write about productivity because I have recently been invested in self-help books, 
and I feel like I've learned some tricks and tips from other professionals on productivity, but I 
also like putting my own spin on things to make myself a little bit more productive than the day 
before. These three topics are three huge passions of mine, so I felt like they would be good 
categories for this blog personal project. 
### Technologies Used 
- In this full-stack application, I used React.js and Next.js to create the blog while using 
Tailwind CSS to style the application while using GraphQL and Hygraph (formerly known as 
GraphCMS) to store data (i.e., posts, comments, categories, and authors) and make queries 
to the database. It was very cool to learn about Next.js and GraphQL since this was my first
project using these technologies, and it was very cool to finally have a working blog 
application where I can share my thoughts and opinions with others.
